<p>这本书我在学校的时候拿着原版书啃了一大半，但是因为那个时候的学习方式的问题，并没有记下来多少，也别提应用到生活工作中。现在情况变了，投入了就需要有收获，借着别人的总结<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10865206-the-willpower-instinct">别人的总结</a>，同时也在路上听书上又听了好几遍，好歹也记录一点东西下来。</p>
<blockquote>
<p>你自己定的方向，也要有个大概的计划，不要老是往后推。你现在不做，之后的自己很大可能也不会做，这样就永远做不了。当然，定了目标，就需要去执行，不然就没有意义了。</p>

<h2 id="willpower">willpower就像肌肉，能通过训练增强，但也有极限</h2>
<ul>
<li>Brain is like a muscle and will improve in certain areas with practice (e.g. juggling improves visual perception of motion, memory games strengthens memory). it also gets tired with use.</li>
<li>we cave to impulses when we're distracted, stressed and tired (the muscle is not effective)</li>
<li>good eating, exercise, sleep all help your willpower muscle</li>
<li>slow breathing, shavasana, exercise, shot of greenery, nap, a little sugar all might help rejuvenate your willpower</li>
<li>if you overburden it, the willpower muscle will get weaker, and it works across different arenas. e.g. students cramming will inhale junk food. dieters cheat on their spouses more.</li>
<li>you can build up your willpower muscle by training it with small non-overwhelming habits (e.g. don't surf the TV during commercials)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="_1">冥想，锻炼你的前额皮质</h2>
<ul>
<li>the prefrontal cortex is your "willpower" organ -- it helps you do the harder thing among different choices</li>
<li>meditation sends blood to the prefrontal cortex and makes it stronger</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="_2">我要做、我不要、我想要</h2>
<ul>
<li>3 aspects of willpower goals: I will, I won't, I want (big goal)</li>
<li>An "I will" problem might be better cast as an "I won't" problem. e.g. if you have trouble with "i will go to bed early" maybe "i won't turn on the TV at night" works better. try to make it fun and playful for you. (instead of "i won't be late" make it "i will always be the first one there" if you're competitive)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="_3">等等，不要冲动！*</h2>
<ul>
<li>our natural impulses: fight or flight. try "pause and plan"</li>
<li>even a 10 mins delay of an impulse will make you reduce your flawed PV calculation of its benefit</li>
<li>don't think about the white bear. suppressing an urge makes it more powerful. instead, "surf the urge." stop and notice every physical response, notice your breathing. accept that you have this feeling sometimes. it's uncontrollable, but remember that you choose whether to act on them or not. remember your goal. the urge will pass like a wave if you wait.</li>
<li>imagine how proud you'd feel not succumbing to your urge.</li>
<li>we cave to impulses when we're distracted, stressed and tired (the muscle is not effective)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="_4">坚持很重要，对自己狠一点</h2>
<ul>
<li>beware moral licensing: that good feeling you get when you finish writing out your to-do list. you haven't actually done anything yet but you feel like you deserve a reward. you don't (basically the angel on your shoulder was satisfied and now all you hear is the demon). instead, ask "why" you resisted or did the hard thing. focus on your goals.</li>
<li>decrease variability: if you slip, make a rule that you will always do that thing for a month. helps you value future time.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="_5">正视多巴胺，善用多巴胺</h2>
<ul>
<li>beware dopamine fueled desires. Dopamine makes you pursue pleasure, it doesn't mean you experience happiness. Notice how it actually feels to actually do the thing you think you want to do. Often not that great.</li>
<li>try to create a dopamine effect for things you want to do (e.g. listen to music while vacuuming)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="_6">时常放松自己</h2>
<ul>
<li>we cave to impulses when we're distracted, stressed and tired (the muscle is not effective)</li>
<li>Beware "what the hell" effect. Forgive yourself for slipping up, it's natural and human. don't think you "blew" the whole diet and binge. </li>
<li>Effective stress relief strategies: exercise, praying, reading, music, time with friends/family, massage, walk outside, meditation, yoga, creative hobby</li>
<li>Worst stress relief strategies: gambling, shopping, smoking, drinking, eating, video games, surfing internet, TV or movies for more than 2 hours.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="_7">在你真正想完成的事情上下更多的功夫，不要等，你会感谢今天的自己 *</h2>
<ul>
<li>Frame the decision as a loss of future benefit instead of a current gain (e.g. is my future awesome body worth this cookie)</li>
<li>pre-commit -- burn your ships. tax your time. destroy your ethernet card, etc.</li>
<li>don't wait for "future you" to complete your to-do list. there is no "future you" that is full of energy, focused, diligent and loves doing taxes.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="_8">群体效应</h2>
<ul>
<li>social proof: what you think others are doing is a huge influence on your behavior. find a group of people who embody your ideals.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="_9">其他</h2>
<ul>
<li>people who think they're especially great at something are the worst</li>
</ul>
