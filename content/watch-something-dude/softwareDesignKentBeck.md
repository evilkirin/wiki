> The moment which design becomes important is when you want to change something.

Knowing what a man looks like really makes it easier to remember the guy.

# Why
- economic driver
    - net present value
    - option’s value, you wanna have more than one options
- personal experience, satisfaction
- sense of service, to other people

## Some Definition
- goal: reducing the amount of coupling(解耦、解耦、解耦)
- coupling means a change would imply a change to another element
    - the cost of changing of software are dominated by rippling changes
- Software Design is **beneficially relating elements**.
    - relationship confers benefits

# When
- Things that push me to design later
    - npv
    - opportunity cost
    - lack of knowledge
        - premature optimization
        - abstraction
- Things that drive me to design sooner
    - desire to have options
    - the economy of scale of doing design while you still have context in your head

# How
> Usually, just big changes in safe, small steps

# Three things
- tolerance of ambiguity, wait until things are clearer
- waiting, to not jump into the first thing that might possibly work
- treating design as a social process
