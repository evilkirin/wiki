* Intelligence is a **liability**
    * it’s actually a problem when you’re trying to write good software
    * smart people can make **progress** without **process*
    * This is **Not** a good thing
* Professionals
    * Design, plan, and prepare first
    * …then do the work
    * This produces better results faster
* **Process** is the difference between: **Software Engineering** and **Programming**
* Software Process
    * Architecture
    * Conventions & Standards
    * Version Control
    * Coordination (agile, etc.)
    * Test-driven development
* Tests Provide
    * Documentation of code
    * Catch future errors
    * Long-term time savings
    * “But tests are just a tool, not a **PROCESS**”
* TDD Defined
    * Decide what the code will do
    * Write a test that will pass if the code does that thing
    * Run the test, see it fail
    * Write the code
    * Run the test, see it pass
* TDD provides
    * Design and plan before you code
    * Document your design
    * Proof that code implements design
    * **Encourages design of testable code**
* Testable code
    * Modular
    * Decoupled design
    * Methods of limited scope
    * Result:
        * Better code in less time.
* Caveat
    * You will have to do this for a while before you will be fast
    * Intelligence is an **asset**
        * be smart about how you test
        * Somethings are too hard to test
        * Some tests are too trivial to be useful
        * Overtesting is possible
        * Exploratory coding w/o tests is OK!
